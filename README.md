## Architecture
Rolling Chat App is crafted on a monolithic architecture with a strong and adaptable infrastructure, intentionally designed for an easy transition to microservices architecture as the app experiences growth and an increase in user traffic.

### Overview
The application is divided into two main components: the **Client** and the **Server**, each operating within its own Docker container for ease of deployment and scalability.

#### Client
The client side, built with React, offers a responsive and interactive user interface. It communicates with the server using RESTful APIs and Socket.io for real-time functionalities.

Key Features:
- Real-time messaging enabled by Socket.io
- Efficient state management using Zustand
- Responsive and modern UI design with TailwindCSS
- Seamless navigation and routing with React Router

#### Server

Node.js and Express.js form the backbone of the server, which handles API requests, manages user sessions, and enables real-time communication.

**Key Components:**
- **User Authentication and Authorization:** Robust mechanisms to secure user access and manage permissions.
- **Database Management:** MongoDB serves as the database, with Mongoose as the ORM for efficient data handling.
- **Real-Time Communication:** Socket.io is utilized for managing real-time messaging and event handling.
- **Mail Service:** Utilizes Nodemailer for email communications, interfacing with an SMTP server to send out mail notifications and updates, enhancing user engagement and app functionality.
- **Scheduled Tasks:** Node-cron is employed for scheduled tasks, especially for database maintenance operations like cleaning up and archiving old data, thereby ensuring optimal database performance.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Winston and Morgan are integrated for detailed logging, which aids in effective monitoring and troubleshooting of the server operations.


**Data Flow:**

1. **User Authentication:** Secure login process with session management post-authentication.
2. **Real-Time Interactions:** Bidirectional communication channel for messaging, established and maintained through Socket.io.
3. **Data Persistence:** MongoDB effectively handles data storage, ensuring integrity and accessibility.
4. **Email Services:** Automated email notifications facilitated by Nodemailer, linked to an SMTP server.
5. **Scheduled Operations:** Regular database maintenance tasks scheduled using node-cron to optimize performance and resource utilization.
6. **Operational Monitoring:** Continuous logging of server activities for efficient monitoring and quick resolution of issues.
